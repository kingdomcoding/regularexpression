ONE MUST DIE FOR THE NATION
�You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die
for the people than the whole nation perish.� John 11:50
bee was drawn into the open window of a car
travelling down the road. The bee was upset, and so
was a boy in the car, who had previously suffered a
severe reaction from a bee sting. But before things got out
of hand, the boy's father caught the bee in his hand and
tossed it back out the window. Then he pulled the car over
to comfort his son. The boy, however, was now desperately
worried that his father would die from the bee sting. "Oh,
no," said the father, showing him that his hand was only
slightly swollen. "The sting won't hurt me like it would you,
so I took the sting for you." And that is just what Jesus did
for us: He took the sting of death for us. That was the
prophecy of Caiaphas, the high priest, about Jesus as
reflected in today�s passage (John 11:51).
There are still many today who reject this wonderful
offer of God�s forgiveness through Jesus, though some
through ignorance. That is why you and I must be ready to
tell others that a saviour has died for their sins. �And how
can they hear without someone preaching to them?
(Romans 10:14c). Are there people around you that must
know that Jesus has died for him? What do you want to do
about it today?
